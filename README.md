## Problem to Solve
The IntelliHive financial dashboard provides a **minimalist** and **user-friendly** interface focused on displaying **account balances** and **recent transactions**. It addresses the need for a simple, accessible tool that allows users to monitor their finances without the complexity of advanced design features or mobile responsiveness.

## Value Proposition
- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: IntelliHive delivers a clean, intuitive interface that provides quick access to essential financial information, eliminating complex navigation.
- **Personalization without Complexity**: Features such as the ability to manage account lists allow users to tailor their experience, ensuring that their most-used accounts are always readily accessible.

## Target Users - Retail Banking
- **Non-Tech-Savvy Users**: Users seeking a simple, accessible interface for easy account navigation.
- **New Bank Account Owners**: Individuals new to banking who need a clear, user-friendly experience to manage and understand their accounts.
- **Advanced Users**: Users who are familiar with personal finance management and require deeper insights, such as account summaries and spending breakdowns, while still valuing simplicity.

## Our Solution
### Core Functionalities:
- Display individual account balances with detailed account information.

### Essential Differentiators:
- **Self-Arranged Account List**: Allows users to rearrange their accounts based on personal importance, prioritizing the most critical accounts at the top.

### Optional (Mock-up Features):
- **Recent Transactions**: Show recent transactions for each linked account, offering users a quick overview of their financial activity.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Provide real-time balance updates via automatic/manual refresh, ensuring users always see the most up-to-date information.
- **Spending Overview Card**: A simple card summarizing spending by key categories (e.g., Groceries, Utilities), giving users a clear snapshot of where their money is going.

## Project Timeline (October 2024)
- **October 10-11**: Research on user needs, technical feasibility, and tech stack selection.
- **October 12-14**: Development phase, building the frontend and backend, implementing wireframes, and connecting APIs.
- **October 15**: Testing phase to ensure functionality and address any critical issues before the demo.

## User Stories and Technical Design

5. **User Access Control (Log in/Log out)**
   - *As a user, I want to log into the system using my username and password, so I can securely access my account.*
   - *As a user, I want an option to reset my password if I forget it, so I can regain access to my account.*
   - *As a system administrator, I want accounts to be locked after 3 failed login attempts, so that the system remains secure.*
   - *As a user, I want to be able to log out from any screen within the system, so I can securely exit my account when I'm done.*

6. **Display Feature Navigation**
   - *As a user, I want easy access to core banking features from the dashboard, so I can perform tasks like viewing account and transaction details, making transfers, and paying bills.*

## Demo Solution vs. "Should Be" Solution

### **Demo Solution** (Implemented under time constraints):
- **Frontend**: Sign-in page and main financial dashboard (account overview, recent transactions, top spending categories).
- **Backend**: User-service and account-service for the demo dashboard. The backend connects to APIs, returning data from static JSON files.

### **Proposed Solution**:
- **Frontend**: React-based interface with customizations for handling user accounts, transactions, and more.
- **Backend**: Microservices architecture deployed on **AWS**, fully integrated with a **Postgres database** for real-time data management. Security is enhanced with **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization.
   - PostgreSQL Database Schema for current dashboard design:
