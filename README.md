# IntelliHive Financial Dashboard

## Problem to Solve
The IntelliHive financial dashboard offers a **minimalist** and **user-friendly** interface that focuses on displaying **account balances** and **recent transactions**. It addresses the need for a simple, accessible tool that allows users to monitor their finances easily, without the complexity of advanced design features or mobile responsiveness.

## Value Proposition

## Target Market
- **Non-Tech-Savvy Users**: People who need a simple, accessible interface for easy account navigation.
- **New Bank Account Owners**: Individuals new to banking who require a clear, user-friendly experience to manage and understand their accounts.
- **Advanced Users**: Users familiar with personal finance management who need deeper insights, such as account summaries and spending breakdowns, while valuing simplicity.

## MVP Solution

### Core Functionalities:
- Display individual account balances along with detailed account information.
- Show recent transactions for each linked account, offering users a quick overview of their financial activity.

### Essential Differentiators:
- **Spending Overview Card**: A simple card summarizing spending by key categories (e.g., Groceries, Utilities), giving users a clear snapshot of where their money is going.

## Project Timeline (October 2024)
- **October 10-11**: Research on user needs, technical feasibility, and tech stack selection.
- **October 12-14**: Development phase, building the frontend and backend, implementing wireframes, and connecting APIs.

## User Stories and Technical Design

### **User Stories**

2. **Recent Transactions Snapshot**
   - *As a retail user, I want to see a snapshot of my recent transactions, so I can monitor my recent spending and deposits.*

3. **Top Expense**

4. **User Access Control (Login)**
   - *As a user, I want to log into the system using my username and password, so I can securely access my account.*
   - *As a user, I want an option to reset my password if I forget it, so I can regain access to my account.*
   - *As a system administrator, I want accounts to be locked after 3 failed login attempts, so that the system remains secure.*

5. **Display Feature Navigation**

### **Demo Solution** (Implemented under time constraints):

- **Backend**: Fully integrated with a **Postgres database** for real-time data management. **Security measures** like user authentication, password encryption, and rate limiting are implemented.

## Features to be Added
- Account grouping and customization for an enhanced user experience.
- Advanced privacy features like account balance visibility toggles for better control.
- Expanded filtering options for transactions by category or date range.
